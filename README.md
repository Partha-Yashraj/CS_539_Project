# Precision Diagnosis with Minimal Features: Breast Cancer Classification

Developed an AI-based solution for breast cancer detection, utilizing cutting-edge machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest Classifiers. The focus was on achieving high diagnostic accuracy while maintaining efficiency, making the solution applicable to real-world healthcare scenarios with limited computational power.

The model was trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using a concise selection of 10 key features, minimizing data complexity without sacrificing accuracy. This streamlined feature selection process led to an accuracy rate of over 90%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting breast cancer cases with minimal but essential input data. The success highlighted the importance of feature optimization in AI-driven healthcare diagnostics.

Designed with scalability and resource constraints in mind, the project ensures that the model can operate effectively in environments where computational resources are limited, such as rural or low-resource healthcare settings. This accessibility has the potential to improve early detection rates in underserved areas, contributing to more equitable healthcare solutions.

Comprehensive validation techniques, including cross-validation and precision-recall metrics, were employed to ensure the model’s robustness and reliability. Potential biases in the dataset were also addressed to refine the model’s predictive capabilities further, making it well-suited for real-world implementation.

This project showcases the practical benefits of machine learning in medical diagnostics, combining advanced algorithms, efficient feature selection, and a focus on real-world applications. It serves as a strong example of how AI can revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy and accessibility in diverse settings.
