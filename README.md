# ECE-CS-539-Project
This project seeks to develop and implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC), in order to detect breast cancer, and thereby diagnose the disease without the need for radiologists. 

Utilizing 10 features (mean values) from the the dataset from Kaggle "Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set" we want to see whether a high accuracy is possible in classifying breast cancer despite the small sample size. Achieving high accuracy by using â…“ of the feature can help areas that do not have access to high-quality resources, data, or the funds to analyze and classify large datasets.
