# Breast Cancer Detection Using Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest Classifier
This project aims to develop and deploy an advanced model consisting of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to detect breast cancer, eliminating the need for expert radiologists.

Leveraging a curated dataset containing 10 key features (mean values) sourced from Kaggle's "Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set," our objective is to assess the feasibility of achieving high accuracy in breast cancer classification, even with a relatively small sample size. This endeavor has the potential to significantly benefit regions lacking access to abundant resources, high-quality data, or the financial means to analyze and categorize extensive datasets.
